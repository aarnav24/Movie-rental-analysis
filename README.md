## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a **comprehensive business intelligence and analytics solution** for a DVD rental store using the **Sakila Movie Rental Database**. The analysis focuses on understanding **customer behavior, rental trends, film performance, inventory efficiency, staff and store operations, geographic demand patterns, and actor influence**.

The primary objective is to support **data-driven decision-making** by transforming raw transactional data into **actionable insights** through structured **Excel-based exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **interactive Power BI dashboards**. The project is designed as a full-cycle analytics workflow, from raw data ingestion to executive-ready reporting.

A **MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive)** analytical framework is applied throughout the project to ensure clarity, completeness, and non-overlapping insights.
